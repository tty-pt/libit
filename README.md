# libit
Originally based on [sem](https://github.com/quirinpa/sem).
Which later turned to [it](https://github.com/tty-pt/it).
Which then got it's own library.

This is a library to make it easy to have an interval tree in your program,
based on Unix vanilla stuff + libdb.

Check out [the header](./include/it.h).
To find out how to use it.

# Dependencies
When linking, you'll need libdb and libbsd.

# Acknowledgements
Thank to Leon for helping me debug the original program (sem).
